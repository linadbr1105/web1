      <h2>내가 추구하는 가치</h2>
      <p><strong>I think this society is sick.</strong><br>
        There are so many <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="-blank" title="instagram">Boasting people</a> and so many people who feel a sense of <b style="background-color:yellow;">relative deprivation</b> either.<br>
        At the same time, they would considers themselves worthless creature.<br>
        They hates their own lives looking at very few people who live splendid lives.<br>
        <strong>Actually, I did.</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px">
        But I decide to love my life from now on.<br>
        Life is a continuous of pain and anxiety, and the flashy moments are literally "moments"<br>
        In other words, we have to accept that there is no reason why our lives are always bright and enjoyable.<br>
        If we fail to do so, we will keep to hate our lives during the dark times that make up most of our lives.<br>
        <b style="color:Tomato;"><strong>We must love even painful moments.</strong></b><br>
